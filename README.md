In this code, the following technologies and components are used:

react-router-dom: This library enables routing in a React application. It provides components like NavLink and Route that help in determining the current route and rendering the corresponding components.

react-transition-group: This library provides components for creating animated transitions between components. In this code, the SwitchTransition component is used to define the transition animation for component changes, and the CSSTransition component provides CSS transition effects during component transitions.

useState: The useState hook is used to manage component state. In this code, it is used to store the value of animate, which determines the type of animation.

useLocation: This hook provides access to the current location object, which contains information about the current URL. It is used to pass the current path to the routing components.


The main structure of the code is as follows:

The header section contains a dropdown menu (select) that allows selecting the animation type. The selected animation type is stored in the animate state using useState.

The menu section contains navigation links (NavLink) to each page. NavLink automatically adds the active class to the current route to highlight the active link.

The main section contains SwitchTransition, which defines the animation for component changes. Inside SwitchTransition, CSSTransition is used along with the Routes component, which handles the rendering of different pages.
